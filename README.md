**Welcome to this repo**
After my first experience with redux(react-reducx), it was time
to learn about thunks, since you can't use async functions in reducers,
you need them to communicate with the backend server.
Another alternative is Redux Toolkit Query which automates parts of
this process but needs good amount of configurations.
There are 3 entities in this app, users, albums and photos.
For managing users I have used Thunks and for albums and photos RTQ
is being used.
Live version of the app is here: https://maryam1982.github.io/Photo-Albums/
